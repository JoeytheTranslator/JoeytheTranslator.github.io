              <p>In a nutshell, only the references drafted by native speakers of the target language should be used. Otherwise, we may put ourselves in an awkward position.</p>
<p>For example, I edited a file translated from Chinese to English today. It's an introduction to specific immigration services in Japan, in which <a href="https://www.gyosei.or.jp/about/language/english">行政書士</a> is mentioned.</p>
<p>Upon a quick research, we can find that there are several translations of this concept, including <a href="http://www.lesj.biz/english/about/about.html">(1) Certified Administrative Procedures Specialist, (2) Administrative Scrivener, and (3) Gyoseishoshi Lawyer</a> with ease.</p>
<p>However, for English native speakers, the second option is odd. Because 'scrivener' is an archaic term used to describe a person whose job involved writing documents or dealing with written documents. When you look it up in a dictionary, 'scrivener' is marked as <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/zhs/%E8%AF%8D%E5%85%B8/%E8%8B%B1%E8%AF%AD/scrivener?q=Scrivener">old use</a>, which means that it's outdated and almost nobody uses it today.</p>
<p>However, we can see the Japanese still use it anyway. For example, I quoted the following from a blog written by a Japanese, &quot;<a href="https://www.relocate.world/articles/find-immigration-specialist-japan">Administrative Scrivener (行政書士: Gyosei Shoshi) is the national license holder who can create documents for visa applications on behalf of the client.</a>&quot;</p>
<p>The issue, I believe, it's because that non-English native speakers tend to omit the nuance behind a term and use them as they see fit. This practice, in the end, became part of the reason why a lot of 'new languages' were created, such as Chinglish, Engrish, Tinglish, Singlish, Konglish, Manglish, and so on.</p>
<p>As a translator, we definitely want to avoid Chinglish or Engrish or something like that. But how?</p>
<p>When working on something new, we usually need to do some research to better understand the stuff we are working on, maybe it's about a specific provision in a jurisdiction that we are not familiar with. The research is almost inevitable. Therefore, the question turns to how should you find solid references or parallel documents.</p>
<p>Taking legal translation for example. Usually, I would use sec.gov, a good database where you can find authentic references. For example, you can type lease agreement in and get a lot of them. But, there are a number of translated documents mixed with authentic ones. Those translations are usually of a low level or standard. You would need to kick them out before you can spend valuable time on the reading.</p>
